# My Portfolio

A modern, developer portfolio created using React.

## Description

As a developer, it is important to have a thoughtful and well-crafted portfolio website to show off important skills and design ability to potential employers.
This was my first time using React in creating a website, and my goal was to design a simple, yet aesthetic layout that was easy for a user to navigate and gather information about myself, my skills and experience, and easy ways to contact me.

### What I Learned

- Using React for the first time to create a website
- Utilizing Netlify, another provider in order to host my portfolio page
- For my portfolio, I used Vite, and frontend developer tool to build my React project
- Further practice with implementing CSS frameworks such as Tailwind CSS
- Use of a variety of React modules for greater styling, such as React icons
